# quick_inventory
This PR hardens the quick_inventory script, adds cross‑distro compatibility (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora + Debian/Ubuntu), mirrors output to screen and file, stabilizes formatting, and expands the README with install/usage instructions.
It also adds a ".gitattributes" to enforce "LF" line endings for shell scripts.
